Problem
Pain is the leader of a secret organization whose goal is to destroy the leaf village(Konoha). After successive failures, the leader has himself appeared for the job. Naruto is the head of the village but he is not in a condition to fight so the future of the village depends on the soldiers who have sworn to obey Naruto till death.

Naruto is a strong leader who loves his villagers more than anything but tactics is not his strong area. He is confused whether they should confront Pain or evacuate the villagers including the soldiers (he loves his villagers more than the village). Since you are his advisor and most trusted friend, Naruto wants you to take the decision.

Pain has a strength of ZZ and is confident that he will succeed. Naruto has NN soldiers under his command numbered 11 through NN. Power of ii-th soldier is denoted by A_iA 
i
​
 . When a soldier attacks pain, his strength gets reduced by the corresponding power of the soldier. However, every action has a reaction so the power of the soldier also gets halved i.e. A_iA 
i
​
  changes to [A_i/2][A 
i
​
 /2]. Each soldier may attack any number of times (including 0). Pain is defeated if his strength is reduced to 0 or less.

Find the minimum number of times the soldiers need to attack so that the village is saved.

Input:
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and ZZ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A_1,A_2,…,A_NA

  the attacking power of the soldiers.
Output:
For each test case, print a single line. If Pain cannot be defeated, this line should contain the string "Evacuate" (without quotes). Otherwise, it should contain the minimum number of times the soldiers need to attack.

Sample Output:

### EXPLANATION:
Soldier with power 17 hits Pain, The new powers of soldiers become [7, 13, 8, 8, 3][7,13,8,8,3] and the strength of pain is reduced to 8, after that any soldier with a power greater than equal to 8 can hit Pain and thus defeat him, hence answer is 2.
