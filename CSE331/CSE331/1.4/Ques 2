Problem
Nathan is preparing for the Dash marathon. He has NN training plans. The ii-th plan has an effectiveness of A_iA 
i
​
 , but requires that at least B_iB 
i
​
  other training plans must be performed before it. A training plan cannot be repeated.

If he performs some K \gt 0K>0 distinct trainings - P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_KP

What is the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans, if he can perform them in any order?

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains NN - the number of training plans.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single real number - the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-6}10

Explanation:
Test case 1: It is optimal for Nathan to not perform any training plans as all the plans have negative A_iA 
i
​
  value.

Test case 2: It is optimal for Nathan to:

First, perform the 44-th training plan (for which B_i = 0B 
i
​
 =0).
Then perform the 22-nd training plan (for which B_i = 1B 
i
​
 =1 which is satisfied as he has already performed 11 training plan)
Test case 3: It is optimal for Nathan to:

First, perform the 11-st training plan (for which B_i = 0B 
i
​
 =0).
Then perform the 22-nd training plan (for which B_i = 1B 
i
​
 =1 which is satisfied as he has already performed 11 training plan)
Then perform the 44-th training plan (for which B_i = 2B 
i
​
 =2 which is satisfied as he has already performed 22 training plans)
