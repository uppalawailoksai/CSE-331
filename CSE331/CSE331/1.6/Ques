Problem
You are given an array of  numbers . In one operation, you can pick any index  and change  to . Given an integer , find the minimum number of operations required to make  the mode of the array.

Note: A number is called the mode of the array if it is more frequent than any other number in the array.

Example: The mode of array  is . The array  does not have any mode.

Input format

The first line contains the number of test cases .
The first line of each test case contains two integers,  and  where N denotes the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains  integers  denoting the contents of the array.
Note: Sum of  over all test cases does not exceed .

Output format

For each test case output a line containing the minimum number of operations required to make  the mode of array .

 Constraints





Sum of  over all test cases is less than or equal to

Explanation
For the first case, we can see that  is already the mode of the array.

For the second case, we can choose index  and do the operation . The array will be . Now,  is the mode of the array.
